# Data-Analyst-Project


I solved this by making 2 rest APIs with PostgreSQL to show:

How was the evolution of women in government during this time? 
http://localhost:5000/api/women-in-goverment/

How was the evolution of the ratio "production employees / supervisory employees" 
during time? 
http://localhost:5000/api/ratio-employees/


steps:
Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies from the requirements file (pip install -r requirements)

install and setup PostgreSQL with the data in txt files

change relevant keys to match

go to your browser localhost:5000 with the selected API
